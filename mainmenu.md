# Main Menu

![Minecraft's Main Menu in Irish](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110356963/182049891-e8e4d66d-3f64-4e6b-a51d-8c08774c0b80.png)

Above is a screenshot of the main menu of Minecraft. 

1. The official title of the game is "Minecraft", so there's no translation for it in Irish. 
   1. Although, if you wish to treat "Minecraft" and "Java/Bedrock Edition" as separate terms;
      1. "Minecraft" remains unchanged; it is the title of the game, a borrowed term.
      2. "Edition" in Irish is "eagrán". So Java Edition would be "eagrán Java"; Bedrock Edition would be "eagrán Bedrock". Both Java and Bedrock are also borrowed terms.
2. The splash text is a variable feature which changes on the game's startup. *TODO; Translations of Splash Text*
3. Imreoir Aonair could be replaced ($);
      1. Add the prefix aon- to imreoir --> aonimreoir
      2. See 4.2 below
4. Mód Ilimreora has some alternatives;
      1. An alternative word for mód could be used; 
          1. mód, dóigh, *potentially other suitable words*
  2. Call the replacement word for mód [x]. The notation for singleplayer and multiplayer should thus be;
        1. [x] aonimreora (following 3.1) --> singleplayer
        2. [x] ilimreora --> multiplayer
5. Realms Minecraft is fine.
    1. Realms is a borrowed term for the feature + see point 1 above.
6. Roghanna could be replaced ($).
    1. Sonra(í), socrú (--> socruithe), athróg(a)
7. Scoir den Chluiche is fine 
    1. (the first c in cluiche could be lowercase).


### Arguments

> $3 The label Imreoir Aonair isn't an accurate description in this context. Imreoir is itself "a player". This button doesn't take us to "a player", it takes us to a mode/way of playing the game. It should be appropriately labelled to reflect this, e.g. as I have recommended.


> $6 Rogha(nna) simply refers to choice(s) one chooses from a collection of things. This button directs us to another menu where what we're doing isn't exactly choosing from a collection; we're in essence modifying variables which give different game experiences depending on what they're set to. A better label is a term which refers to the things themselves, keeping in mind that they can be changed, but still be the same things; just with different values. I have recommended some.
