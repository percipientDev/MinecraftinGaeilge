# MinecraftinGaeilge
An evaluation of the use of the Irish language in Minecraft, with some proposals where relevant. For learners of Irish, by a learner of Irish.


I have taken the liberty to use some notations;

- I use numbered lists to order my points.
- ($) will be used where I dispute the use of a word. There will be arguments in a separate section within a document concerning this, e.g. an argument in point 3 is referred to with $3.
- Sometimes, I suggest alternatives for words, e.g. for m√≥d. This results in a comma-separated list, where I include the word I'm proposing an alternative for. This is to reflect that I have nothing wrong with the word in question; only that other words can be used in its place. I also hope to include dialectal information in the distant future.
